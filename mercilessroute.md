# Undertale - Genocide Route

## Records
[speedrun.com](http://www.speedrun.com/undertale)

## Route Rules
- Start with a 0-reset fresh game. You can do this by deleting the UNDERTALE folder located in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local`.
- Complete the Genocide Route.

-----

## Tricks and info
- Wallhumping: Holding `UP` + `DOWN` while against an upper wall allows you to rapidly swap between facing up and down, which is good for battle hunting.
- Holding `X / SHIFT` while in battle allows your SOUL to move slower.
- SAVE sparingly.
- Rapidly hitting `Z / ENTER` and `X / SHIFT` allows rapid text though most dialogue.

-----

## Beginning

Name the Fallen Human a one character name.

## Ruins - 20 EXECUTIONS

Enemy | `FIGHT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Froggit | `30HP | Green+Out` | Hitting his jump will end his action. Scripted Froggit needs to be near perfect.
Whimsun | `10HP | Out` |
Moldsmal | `50HP | `Green+Red` |

### Flowey
- It's faster to hit the bullets. Run into them into the upper right corner, then into the circle at the bottom left.

### Dummy
- `ACT`: `Talk`

Scripted Froggit needs to be hit near perfectly to kill it in 1 hit and brings you to level 2 (doesn't count towards 20, still better to kill).

After getting to the save point room, grind an encounter just before going to the next room.

Next room fall down and go back up, grind an encounter in this room just before the exit to the next.

Switch back and forth between the single rock room and the one before it to get encounters faster. Some people do this with the save room and the one after it, there's no clear answer to which way is better. Get your 13th on the right side of the single rock room, all the others shouldn't activate Toriel's phone call. More Whimsun is always better.

The rest of the encounters are all done in the triple rock room only, so after getting one leaving and going back in to get the next. In Froggit+Whimsun fights, kill Whimsun first so you have a chance to skip the Froggit's attack. (Keep in mind most of the top runners reset if they don't leave this room by a certain time, usually 8:15.) RNG best>worst for the triple rock room depends on how many you went into the room with, but Moldsmal are the longest fight, Froggit+Whimsun is always good.

If you got 20 encounters Napstablook will fade away, mash through all the "but nobody came" and run to Toriel, skip the pie and go talk to her, say the first option for her first 2 questions and that you want to leave to the 3rd, then follow her.

Toriel | `One Hit Kill`

##Snowdin - 16 EXECUTIONS

Enemy | `FIGHT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Snowdrake | `70~80HP | Green+Red` |
Icecap | `50HP | Green` |
Doggo | `Green+~Out` | Taking damage (moving) stops his action.
Lesser Dog | `Yellow+Out` |
Jerry | `Spare` | Kill him if he's the very last monster. Lots of greens.
Chilldrake | `70~80HP | Green+Out |
Married Dogs | `110HP | 2Green+Out` | Killing Dogaressa first makes Dogamy die in one hit.
Greater Dog | `110HP | 2Green+Out` | Hitting him on the ground stops his action.

Mash through everything until the save point room, get the Tough Glove from the box and equip it. Grind a Snowdrake on the save screen.

On the next screen after Sans/Papyrus talk you should get a Ice Cap without needing to grind for it, kill it.

Run into Doggo's attack to kill him faster.

Grind a Lesser Dog on the ice screen.

Grind for a fight on the small bridge before the Dogaressa fight, kill whatever is there besides Jerry, then spare Jerry.

Move up a bit before solving the ice puzzle and then right so you can hold right and get through, this saves a few frames and is safer.

Greater Dog has 2 attacks, spear is unskipable, dog can be hit and skipped, for both attacks, hold down to start.

Grind the rest of your encounters on the last screen before Snowdin, kill all but Jerry then spare him. Some people prefer to grind more encounters earlier, though again there is no definite answer on how many is better.

If you have 13 encounters and get an Ice Cap/Jerry/Snowdrake, or 14 and get Ice Cap/Jerry (only 2 possible fights) then it's faster to kill Jerry when it's alone to finish off Snowdin.

Papyrus | `One Hit Kill`

## Waterfall

Enemy | `FIGHT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
TG Aaron | `98HP | Green+Red` | 
TG Woshua | `70HP | Out+Red` |
TG Moldsmal | `50 HP | Yellow` |
BS Moldsmal | `50HP | GreenGreenYellow` |
BS Shyren | `70HP | GreenGreenGreen` |
BS Temmie | `10 hP | aUT` | bOI!!!!
BS Aaron | `98 HP | GreenGreenGreen + GreenOutOut |
BS Moldbygg | `80HP | GreenGreenGreen`|
BS Woshua | `70HP | GreenGreenYellow` |


Scripted Aaron and Woshua fights count as 2.

- Undyne chase is just avoiding the spears, be careful not to get caught on the edge of a platform or you will get hit, the spears also seem to have weird hitboxes.

Go left in the bright room and walk to just before the Ballet Shoes room, grind a scripted 2 Moldsmal encounter then get the Ballet Shoes.

Walk past the room and you'll get an encounter on the way which can be nearly anything, even single or double, so your total up to now will be 5 or 6.

Scripted Shyren 2 rooms later gives you 6 or 7.

Walk up to make Monster Kid walk to you faster.

Mad Dummy can be 1 shot from nearly anywhere.

Safety for Sans that costs 3 seconds: buy a Sea Tea.

Scripted Temmie gives you 8 or 9, Temmie is the only single encounter from now on.

Go through the rest of the waterfall to get the last encounters, anything can be 1 shot besides Aaron with good enough timing, if you have an odd number getting another Temmie balances it out. Grind in the last room with encounters (crystal room) to finish up the Waterfall.

Hitting the save point before Undyne loses 1 seconds but restores health, this fight is just something that needs to be practiced.

Enemy | `MURDER` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Monster Kid | `LITTLE BRAT RUNS AWAY` |
Undyne | `23000 HP`| Hitting her perfectly (1700+) and not losing too many cycles will grant you an early kill.

# `OHHHHH YES!`
- You need 12k ratings to finish the battle. You start with 4k.
- Equip the `Faded Ribbon (+1500 > 5500)`.
- Equip the `Manly Bandanna (+1500 > 7000)`
- Equip the `Old Tutu (+1500 > 8500)`.
- Equip the `Cloudy Glasses (+1500 > 10000)`.
- Equip the `Stained Apron (+1500 > 11500)`. Do this last so you don't have to later.
- The extra 500 points need to be earned by shooting the bombs, MTT minis, squares, and hands. Getting hit gives points.
- Typing `legs` during the essay gives `+350 > 11850`. 150 points should not be difficult to obtain otherwise.

The battle should be over by now.

Mash through everything while getting the keys. Do you really need a guide for this???

Grab the `Worn Dagger`.

- Phase 5: Middle pan for the `ACT`. You can move above the pan for this.
- Phase 6: Close and reload the game as soon as the bullets turn into flowers.
- Don't die?????????

`FIGHT` him afterwards, it's faster. Immediately close and restart the game once the first letter pops up from Flowey.

Head to Waterfall with the Riverman (or the Riverwoman?).

## The Barrier
`SAVE` before Asgore to heal to full.

Mash through everything.

### Asriel Dreemurr
Wait for the music to kick in (rainbow effects), then `Hope` every time. Don't die and stuff.

### Asriel Dreemurr Kai Ni
`Struggle` for 4 turns. If you got hit by a diamond in the previous phase, you will start at 1/20 HP. If so, kill yourself on turn 1, survive turns 2 and 3, then kill yourself on turn 4. If you do NOT get hit by the diamond, pray that you don't die at all. Remember - dying the first time loses 10 seconds, but if you would probably die anyways, save yourself the time and kill yourself at the start of the attack.

`SAVE` your friends!

Don't comfort Asriel. It's faster.

Mash through The End.
